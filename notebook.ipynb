    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythia is a standard tool for the generation of high-energy collisions,\n",
    "comprising a coherent set of physics models for the evolution from a few-body high-energy (\"hard\") scattering process to a complex multihadronic final state.\n",
    "The particles are produced in vacuum.\n",
    "Simulation of the interaction of the produced particles with detector material is not included in Pythia but can, if needed, be done by interfacing to external detector-simulation codes.\n",
    "The Pythia 8.3 code package contains a library of hard interactions and models for initial- and final-state parton showers, multiple parton-parton interactions, beam remnants, string fragmentation, and particle decays.\n",
    "It also has a set of utilities and interfaces to external programs.\n",
    "Full Pythia documentation can be found [here](https://pythia.org/documentation/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythia has included a Python interface to the underlying C++ since `v8.219`,\n",
    "and it was redesigned to handle C++11 using `pyBind11` since `v8.301`,\n",
    "allowing users to generate a [custom Python interface](https://pythia.org/latest-manual/PythonInterface.html).\n",
    "The binding interface is bi-directional,\n",
    "so not only can you pass a (C++) Pythia object to Python,\n",
    "you can create a Python object and pass it to Pythia\n",
    "(example [here](https://pythia.org/latest-manual/examples/main10-python.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook talk will showcase the power and flexibility of\n",
    "Pythia's default, simplified Python interface by presenting its basic features\n",
    "and walking through a simple event-generation and analysis workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythia 8 is a small, standalone package, easily installed on a laptop.\n",
    "Official installation instructions can be found [here](https://pythia.org/releases/),\n",
    "but it is also available on [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pythia8).\n",
    "You may also want to look at the [Conda environment file](environment.yml) used for this talk."

To exemplify, consider a top quark produced in the hard interaction, initially with positive status code. When later a shower branching $ \\t \\to \\t \\g $ occurs, the new $\\t$ and $\\g$ are added at the bottom of the then-current event record, but the old $\\t$ is **not removed**. It is marked as decayed, however, by negating its status code. At any stage of the shower there is thus only one \"current\" copy of the top.

One such is when \"the same\" particle appears as a second copy, e.g. because its momentum has been shifted by it taking a recoil in the dipole picture of parton showers. Then the original has both daughter indices pointing to the same particle, which in its turn has both mother pointers referring back to the original. Another special case is the description of ISR by backwards evolution, where the mother is constructed at a later stage than the daughter, and therefore appears below it in the event listing. \n",

    "### Colour flow information\n",
    "\n",
    "The colour flow information is based on the Les Houches Accord convention (see [Generic User Process Interface for Event Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0109068)). In it, the number of colours is assumed infinite, so that each new colour line can be assigned a new separate colour. These colours are given consecutive labels:\n",
    "`101`, `102`, `103`, ... A gluon has both a colour and an anticolour label, an (anti)quark only (anti)colour. \n",
    "\n",
    "While colours are traced consistently through hard processes and parton showers, the subsequent beam-remnant-handling step often involves a drastic change of colour labels. Firstly, previously unrelated colours and anticolours taken from the beams may at this stage be associated with each other, and be relabelled accordingly. Secondly, it appears that the close space-time overlap of many colour fields leads to reconnections, i.e. a swapping of colour labels, that tends to reduce the total length of field lines."

The mean and width assumes that all the contents is in the middle of the respective bin. This is especially relevant when you plot a integer quantity, such as a multiplicity.
